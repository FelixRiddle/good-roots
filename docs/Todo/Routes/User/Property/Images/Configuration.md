# Configuration

I need finer control than this, we're going to do this
I will just mark it has completed when it's done in the backend(which is the only part that matters).

- [ ] Create a js configuration file, export it to the frontend and also use it in the backend
    - [ ] Images
        - [x] Maximum 10
        - [ ] Minimum 1
            - [ ] Properties with no images can't be published.
            <!-- This is a quality control -->
    - [ ] Size
        - [ ] Maximum 5mb
        - [ ] Minimum 100kb ðŸ¥¶
        <!-- I'm not so sure about this '1kb' thing, because it has to be pretty low res for it to be so low -->
        <!-- Update: Changed it to 100 kb, because I've scaled down a house to 1366x768 and it weights 891kb ðŸ˜’ -->
        <!-- 100kb is already a dubious image, keep a watch on bro ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤¨ðŸ˜¤ -->

- [ ] Configuration validation
- [ ] Configuration testing
