# Property bugs

- [x][Fixed] Fetch all is not fetching some properties

I can see the same property in grid view and on my profile, but not when fetching it on the map.

Maybe because it uses user specific properties?

Note: It was actually fetching all properties, but the code crashed before showing them.

# Map bugs

- [x][Fixed] Not every location in the map is being shown
- [x][Fixed] When a marker is shown in the map and you click on it, it shows nothing.
