# Frontend

Because in the course the frontend is in pug, I did it in pug

- [x] Pug

But I could also use the same backend and do it in other frontends, to prove that it's easy to do.
Use other frontend frameworks for this project:

- [ ] Vue.js
- [ ] React.js
    - [ ] React Native
    - [ ] Next.js
