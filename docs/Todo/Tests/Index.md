- [ ] Login
    - [ ] The user that is logged in can make changes on protected endpoints
- [ ] Register

# Security

- [ ] Only users with confirmed email can access protected endpoints
- [ ] Every protected endpoint is accessible to a user
- [ ] Every protected endpoint is not accessible to a person that is not logged in
- [ ] A user logged in can't change other users data by accessing protected endpoints

Only when all these tests pass, can the website be considered secure.
