# Geocoder problems

# 'L.Control.Geocoder is not a function' after importing the script

The geocoder control script is imported after leaflet script, but still doesn't work.

Reference/s:
[Uncaught TypeError: L.Control.geocoder is not a function - A Search Error Caused by Leaflet Control](https://copyprogramming.com/howto/leaflet-control-search-error-uncaught-typeerror-l-control-geocoder-is-not-a-function)

Couldn't fix, rather use another API.
